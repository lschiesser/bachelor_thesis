\section{Discussion of Results}
\begin{changemargin}{50pt}{50pt}
 Plausibility of models in terms of recorded metrics, i.e., sensitivity, 
specificity, ... and what that means for their predictive ``statements''
\\
Accordance of feature importance and scientific research (do most important 
features in model coincide with blood values identified as being evidence for a 
COVID-19 illness)
\end{changemargin}
\section{Discussion of Methods}
% auf non-normality eingehen und die zwei Methoden pr√§sentieren
\begin{changemargin}{50pt}{50pt}
Shortly mention that R implementation is not able to apply MICE model to other 
data only to data it is ``trained''/ ``fitted'' on (or maybe that's for the 
\ref{discussion} Discussion section)
\\
discuss imputation process further and its connection to cross-validation, 
keyword: data leakage
\\
discuss the original paper in light of replication and open science, e.g., lack 
of information about parameters/settings, missing information regarding 
results, ...
\end{changemargin}
