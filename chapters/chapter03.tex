\section{Results of own implementation}
Table \ref{tab:training-acc} and \ref{tab:training-b_acc} show the mean and 
standard deviation for the accuracy and balanced accuracy of the models during 
nested cross-validation. The authors of the original paper provided a 95\% 
confidence interval for these two measures. Since there is no information on 
how they computed this interval, it is assumed that they used a two-sided 
Student's t-distribution which is used to estimate the mean of normally 
distributed populations where sample size is small. It is calculated using the 
following formula $\bar{x} \pm \frac{t_{\alpha, v}s}{\sqrt{n}}$ where 
$t_{\alpha, v}$ is the t-value which can be taken from a table with $\alpha$ 
as the degress of freedom $n-1$ and $v$ is the confidence level, $s$ is the 
sample variance, $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, and $n$ is the number of samples.
For Random Forest, the 95\% confidence interval of the average accuracy is 
[0.76, 0.80] and of the average balanced accuracy is [0.73, 0.77]. For Logisitc 
Regression, the confidence interval of the average accuracy is [0.72, 0.77] and 
of the average balanced accuracy is [0.68, 0,72]. Since the confidence 
intervals of the accuracy and balanced accuracy for both classifiers overlap or 
are near each other, it can be assumed that the slight imbalance of the data 
set had no signifcant effect on the classifer and that the classifier therefore 
is not biased against the outcomes of the target variable.

The best models where selected by searching for the model with the most numbers 
of highest evauation measures. The best Random Forest Classifier used maximally 
4 features and 500 estimators, it achieved an accuracy of 87.5\% and a 
sensitivity of 90\%. The best Logisitc Regression Classifier used a C of 10, a 
maximal iteration of 200, and the 'liblinear' solver, it achieved an accuracy 
of 83.9\% and a sensitivity of 85\%. These settings were then used to retrain 
the classifiers and compute the validation metrics.
