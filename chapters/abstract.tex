This thesis replicates a study training different classifiers to predict the 
outcome of a PCR test for COVID-19 based on a routine blood exam. It 
reproduces the Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifiers. They were 
trained using 5-fold nested cross validation and compared to the classifiers' 
performance in the original paper. The replicated classifiers underperformed 
when contrasted with the original classifiers. However, they were still 
statistically significant and showed congruency with regards to findings from 
medical research. By focusing testing efforts on patients with a high 
probability of having contracted the virus, models like these can help assist 
medical staff during situations where testing capacities are restricted due to 
shortages in material or personnel.
